# Robot Simulator Project

## Overview
This project is a basic robot simulator where users can control a robot in a virtual environment. The robot is equipped with wheels for movement and a distance sensor for obstacle detection.

## Features
- Move the robot forward and backward with `W` and `S` keys.
- Robot movement is controlled through torque applied to wheels.
- Distance sensor detects obstacles in front of the robot.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in **Unity**.
3. Attach the necessary components to your robot model (e.g., WheelColliders, Rigidbody, etc.).
4. Play the scene to start controlling your robot with the `W` and `S` keys.

## Future Plans
- Add more sensors (e.g., touch sensors, gyros, color sensors).
- Implement graphical robot building interface.
- Add AI competitors for robot challenges.
- Android studio integration

## Setup Instructions

- Clone the repo
